A better way to manage your browser's built-in reading list

Better Reading List makes it easier to read and add item to Chrome's built in Reading List.
If you use the browser's native Reading List, this is a must have extension for you.

With Better Reading List, you can quickly add the current tab to the Reading List.
The extension also let's you:
- Filter your Reading List for read/unread items
- and automatically mark open items as Read (enable it in Settings).
